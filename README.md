Starbound Scramblers: Alexia Riner and Rachel Xie

You’re a lone astronaut who woke up on an alien planet, stuck in a cave. You must navigate
through the cave system and find your way back to your ship. Along the way, you will encounter
aliens and glowing spikes that stand in your way. Find your gun and shoot at the aliens until all
have been eliminated. If you run out of ammo, find an ammo pickup. Be careful; if the glowing
spikes do too much damage, you’ll have to restart at your current level. Pick up aid kits to
replenish health. If you survive and eliminate all aliens, you’ll move on to the next level.
